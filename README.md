# Draw-quessing

Written in Python, also using Tkinter for the GUI.

This project was also intended to be presented at "Zilele Clujului," but I haven't finished it and am not happy with its current state.

Initially, I tried to use an AI to recognize the drawings of the participants, but I haven't found one advanced enough. So, I decided to use some mathematical formulas to identify the shapes that the players drew, but it didn't quite work.

Right now, I am researching AI to see when they will be able to do that.
